# Data Bases 2 - Project

This is a complementary project for the Master's Degree course **Data Bases 2**.

📞 This project aims to create a website for a *telco* company that enables users to look for available service packages the company offers and buy them.

⚙️ This platform also allows employees to log in as **administrators**, manage plans and service packages, and access a *Sales Report* page to inspect sales trends and users.

👨🏼‍💻 Using a relational database, this project exploits **Java Servlets** to handle requests and responses, and **MySQL** to persist data regarding users, service packages, plans, and sales.
